# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    depends_on: 
      - db

    #  The `db-data` volume persists the database data between container restarts.
    #  The `db-password` secret is used to set the database password.
    #  You must create `db/password.txt` and add a password of your choosing to it before running `docker-compose up`.
